# Portfolieth

_Version: 1.0.1_

Portfolieth is a free, open-source, lightweight chrome extension that displays an Ethereum address in the context of a cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

## Why?

No other blockchain explorers let me save my Ether addresses for practicality and also didnt give detailed breakdowns of how my tokens were performing.
So I created Portfolieth as a local HTML application over the past year but then adapted it in to a chrome extension so I could save all my Ether addresses and quickly check up on how each one was doing.

## Features

Portfolieth can... 

- Save Ethereum addresses into your Ethereum Address Book as nicknames
- Show you a percentage change of your saved addresses from last check
- Give a detailed break down of Ether and tokens held by an address including 24 hour, 7 day and 30 day price difference percentages
- Hide / show spam tokens
- Get all the above data and a total portfolio value figure in under half a second thanks to the super fast Ethplorer.io API!
- Protect you from malicious websites targeting crypto users. Portfolieth uses EAL and Metamask URL analysis and blacklists to stop you from being scammed by malicious crypto websites.
